# Colorado Motor Speech Framework Scoring Form

### GitHub Structure
---
- The `main` branch contains the source code for the website that can be changed
- The `gh-pages` branch contains the code after it is built and ready to be deployed as a webpage. This code is automatically generated  and deployed when changes to `main` are made

### JSON Data
---
The JSON data can be found at this path in the `main` branch:
- `src`/
	- `data`/
		- `characteristics.json` (All  yes/no characteristic groups, their scoring values, and extra notes)
		- `custom.json` (characteristics that are more than just Yes/No)
		- `locations.json` (physical locations and conditions for those areas)
		- `tasks.json` (tasks for each characteristic)

##### `characteristics.json`

Example snippet from this file:

```
"Rate of Speech": {

	"Slow rate of speech": [
		[1,"(can be compensatory or primary)"],
		[1, "(uncommon)"],
		[2, ""],
		[0, ""],
		[1, ""],
		[1, ""],
		[1, ""]
	],
	"Fast rate of speech": [
	
		[...]
		
}

```

`Rate of Speech` is the characteristic group name and will be displayed as the group title
- `Slow rate of speech` and `Fast Rate of Speech` are individual characteristics/rows within this grouping
	- Each characteristic/row contains an array of values corresponding to each column, ultimately providing data for the cell at that row/column intersection
		- The columns are currently `Flaccid, UUMN, Spastic, Hypokinetic, Hyperkinetic, Ataxic, Apraxia of Speech` which is why each characteristic has an array with 7 elements
	- Each cell uses an array of 2 values, the first being the score and the second being notes for that cell
		- -1 = red/"-", 0 = neutral, 1 = yellow/"X", 2 = green/"XX"

If adding a new **row**, it is usually easiest to copy and paste this template underneath the last row in a group and then change values from there. A comma will need to be added to the last row before adding in a new one.

```
	"(row name here)": [
		[0,""],
		[0, ""],
		[0, ""],
		[0, ""],
		[0, ""],
		[0, ""],
		[0, ""]
	]
```


If adding a new column, a new element would have to be added to each row containing the data for that column. It would need to be inserted in the same position as the new column, so if the new column was at the end, we would add  a new `[0, ""]` at the end of each row. The column would also have to be added in locations.json in order to show up correctly


##### `custom.json`

Currently, `custom.json` handles two `type` values: `number` and `select`. `number` handles all numerical values and can be set to either be a score out of a certain number or out of a certain percentage. `select` handles characteristics that have a set list of options, such as low, moderate, high. Each type must have the structures shown below.

###### `number` example

```
"Self-Rating": {
	"type": "number",
	"max": 7,
	"value": "number",
	"tip": "Ask the patient: 'On a scale of 1-7, 1 being the worst and 7 being the best, how would you rate your speech right now?'"
},
```

- `"type"` is set to `number`
- `"max"` represents the highest score, in this case 7
- `"value"` can either be `number` or `percentage`, which will define which units to use for the score
- `"tip"` contains the information that will be shown when the user hovers over the 'i' icon next to each characteristic
- The minimum is automatically set to 0
- `"max"` and `"value"` are exclusive to this type

###### `select` example


```
"Naturalness": {
	"type": "select",
	"options": ["WFL", "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe", "Profound"],
	"tip": "Judge during running speech of how well speech matches normal stands of rate, pitch, and loudness."

},
```

- `"type"` is set to `select`
- `"options"` is an array containing each option shown to the user, each of which must be wrapped in quotes and separated by commas
- `"tip"` has the same usage as it does for number values
- `"options"` is exclusive to this type
